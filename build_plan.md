**Request:** "Implement user authentication endpoints with JWT."

### Step 6: Client Management Endpoints

**Action:** Create API endpoints to add, get, update, and delete client information.

**Request:** "Create API endpoints for client management."

### Step 7: Scheduling Endpoints

**Action:** Implement API endpoints to create, view, update, and delete appointments. Include functionality to assign team members to appointments.

**Request:** "Implement API endpoints for scheduling."

### Step 8: Invoice Generation Endpoints

**Action:** Create API endpoints to generate, send, and track invoices.

**Request:** "Create API endpoints for invoice generation."

### Step 9: Team Management Endpoints

**Action:** Implement API endpoints to add, get, update, and delete team member information. Include functionality to manage roles and availability.

**Request:** "Implement API endpoints for team management."

## Phase 3: Mobile Application Development

### Step 10: React Native Project Setup

**Action:** Initialize a new React Native project using TypeScript.

**Request:** "Initialize a React Native project with TypeScript."

### Step 11: Install Mobile Dependencies

**Action:** Install necessary dependencies for the mobile app (navigation, state management, UI components, etc.).

**Request:** "Install the necessary dependencies for the React Native app."

### Step 12: User Authentication UI

**Action:** Build the UI components for user registration, login, and logout, integrating with the backend API.

**Request:** "Build the UI for user authentication in the mobile app."

### Step 13: Client Management UI

**Action:** Create UI components to display, add, edit, and delete client information, interacting with the corresponding API endpoints.

**Request:** "Create the UI for client management in the mobile app."

### Step 14: Scheduling UI

**Action:** Build UI components for viewing, creating, updating, and deleting appointments, including a calendar view and team member assignment.

**Request:** "Build the UI for scheduling in the mobile app."

### Step 15: Invoice UI

**Action:** Create UI components to display invoices and their payment status.

**Request:** "Create the UI for viewing invoices in the mobile app."

### Step 16: Team Management UI

**Action:** Build UI components to display, add, edit, and delete team member information, including role and availability management.

**Request:** "Build the UI for team management in the mobile app."

## Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

### Step 17: API Testing

**Action:** Write unit and integration tests for all API endpoints.

**Request:** "Write tests for the API endpoints."

### Step 18: Mobile App Testing

**Action:** Write unit and end-to-end tests for the mobile application.

**Request:** "Write tests for the mobile app."

### Step 19: Code Refactoring

**Action:** Review and refactor code for both the backend and mobile app to improve maintainability, readability, and performance.

**Request:** "Refactor the codebase for improvements."

## Phase 5: Deployment

### Step 20: Backend Deployment Setup

**Action:** Configure the backend for deployment on AWS (or another cloud provider), including setting up EC2 instances, load balancers, and potentially containerization with Docker.

**Request:** "Set up the backend for deployment on AWS."

### Step 21: Mobile App Deployment

**Action:** Prepare the mobile app for release on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, following their respective guidelines.

**Request:** "Prepare the mobile app for release on the app stores."

**End of Initial Build**

This plan covers the initial build of the Cleaning Business SaaS application. Further features and enhancements can be added iteratively. Remember to request each step from me in order, and I will provide the necessary code and guidance.
